🚀 Let's reimagine the traditional Pomodoro technique by infusing it with **collaboration** and **creativity**.

## How does it work?

1) **Join** 🤝
   Join or create a room with friends, colleagues, or other enthusiasts.

2) **Pomodoro** 🍅
   Choose your time settings and focus on work, reading, or studying for the session.

3) **Draw** 🎨
   After you complete a pomodoro session, draw pixels on the collaborative canvas.

4) **Chat** 💬
   Enjoy your breaks while chatting with everyone in the room.
